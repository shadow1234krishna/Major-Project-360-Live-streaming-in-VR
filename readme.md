# MAJOR_PROJECT_DOCS_KWDR
this repository collects all informations and documetations about all structures and remote 
repositories of the application

> this project have future work and some requirements to be added like extra security , extra test codes , underlying infra for tha application

# PROJECT IDEA
> The 360 degree live streaming system is used to provide user the real time experience through VR.
The live streaming system help in various sports , education sectors such as VR classroom, VR Sport matches(Football) etc.

# HOW IT WORKS
embeded code stored in streams service to be fetched in frontend to stream the content which getting streaming by obs with dacast platform for video content with 360
user service where jwt getting issued and trusted

# HOW IT RUNS
each repository of them have readme file describes the service and its rule.
### it requires some types of setup:
* resources setup:
    - Minikube or any K8S Cluster
* networking setup:
    - istio installation 
* environment setup:
    - namespaces injections
    - kubernates package manager 
* CICD setup
    - jenkins server
    - sonarqube server
